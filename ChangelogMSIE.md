Version 1.14 released on November 21, 2014.
  * Added support for pretty urls with basic url rewriting for 404 errors ([Issue 81](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=81)). See the ["web\_server"]["404\_handler"] option on the [Settings](Settings.md) wiki page.
  * Fixed Mongoose environment variables: REQUEST\_URI, PHP\_SELF, SCRIPT\_NAME, SCRIPT\_FILENAME, PATH\_TRANSLATED ([Issue 137](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=137))
  * Fixed -400 loading error when navigating Back and Forward in history after a POST request was made ([Issue 138](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=138))
  * Fixed problems when OS environment variables exceed 4KB in size ([Issue 128](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=128))
  * Added missing CGI environment variables: `%windir%` and many others. See [Issue 136](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=136).


Version 1.13 released on February 1, 2014.
  * Fixed problems when the temp directory returned by OS contained unicode characters. In such case phpdesktop will try other fallbacks like "C:\Windows\Temp" among others ([Issue 71](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=71)).

Version 1.12 released on January 25, 2014.
  * Fixed issues with web server port conflicts. When web server listening port is set to 0 in settings.json, OS will assign a random free port. Multiple instances of phpdesktop applications may now be running simultenously without problems ([Issue 9](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=9)).
  * Fixed long path causing error when spawning CGI process ([Issue 63](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=63))
  * Fixed mongoose webserver issues when unicode characters are in path
  * Added the --cgi-environment argument that can be passed to the phpdesktop executable to pass arbitrary environment variables to PHP scripts. See the [CommandLineArguments](CommandLineArguments.md) wiki page. See [Issue 43](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=43).
  * Added the "start\_maximized" option to settings.json ([Issue 24](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=24)).
  * Added the PHPDESKTOP\_VERSION environment variable. You can access it through `$_ENV` global variable.
  * Added the temp-dir.php example
  * Added the "cgi\_temp\_dir" option to settings.json ([Issue 70](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=70)).

Version 1.11 released on January 22, 2014.
  * Fixed errors when application path contained spaces ([Issue 40](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=40)).
  * Fixed mongoose webserver hanging when closing application on Win7 ([Issue 61](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=61)).
  * Fixed temp directory problems, including upload and session problems (see [Issue 39](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=39), [Issue 23](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=23)).
  * Fixed issues with clipboard Copy/Cut commands ([Issue 30](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=30)).
  * Fixed problems with links like "javascript:void(0)". These are not allowed anymore, as they cause to open Internet Explorer 9 download dialog on Win7. Replaced such links with hash "#".
  * Added the upload and session examples ([Issue 41](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=41)).
  * Added the sqlite example ([Issue 32](https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/issues/detail?id=32)).
  * Added the cookies example
  * Added the no-cache example
